    <p>Rocket League is cars meeting soccar plain and simple. Of course these cars
      also have rockets at their back to distinguish from your '97 Honda Accord.
      Put the ball in the net.  That is the only objective, and that is the only
      objective needed for non-stop fun.  Players get out of this game what they put in.
      The skill ceiling is immense, hence why an esports scene has sprouted around this
      familiar game concept.  Experience the thrill akin to playing real sports.  You will
      miss shots that you know you can hit.  You will get dribbled by opponents. Finally,
      if you stick around long enough, you will fly!  Once you start flying, Rocket League's
      fun and difficulty sky rocket along with you.  No game will be the same.  Nothing can
      compare to the rush of a overtime save, or even goal.  And then you can play another.
