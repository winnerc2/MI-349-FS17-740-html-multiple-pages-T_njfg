    <p>Dark souls 3 is a great game for gamers who long for a challenge once more.
      Too often modern games hold your hand desperately trying to keep your attention.
      Well not Dark Souls 3.  The third official game in the series built around
      slogan <i>Prepare to Die</i>.  Dark Souls 3 is a strategic combat focused game.
      It must be as the wrong mentality will cause the impatient to die over and over,
      in an unforgiving way.  Souls are both your character's experience and Currency.
      Be wary of stock-piling it though as when you die, all of your held souls are droppped.
      You will have one chance to return to the spot you died to retreive them, however if
      you fail they will be gone forever.  This mechanic along with the checkpoint system
      combines for an extremely immersive game worth trying out.
