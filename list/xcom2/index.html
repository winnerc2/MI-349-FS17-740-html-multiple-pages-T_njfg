      Xcom 2 is a turn based strategy game in which you get to command a rebel group rebelling
      against the alien leadership which took over Earth following the events of
      Xcom 1.  At it's center is a system centered around gaming an RNG roll. The majority
      of attacks in this game have a percent chance to miss. Many things come into play
      to determine the odds of succeeding. The fun and challenge to this game is minimizing
      the chances of harm coming to your troops in every possible outcome possible.  Gamble
      in the wrong way and a solider can die in one enemy turn easily, and when that happens
      they are gone forever.  Even wounds will put your soldier out of commission for a period
      in which a rookie will have to try to pull their weight.  Which thanks to the level / perk
      system is a huge liability.  Not to mention the fact that the rookies ineptness could very
      well get another one of your soliders hurt themselves.  Not for the faint of heart, but
      a very rewarding and replayable strategy to be sure.
